linters:
  disable-all: true
  enable:
    #- exhaustive    # check exhaustiveness of enum switch statements
    #- funlen        # Tool for detection of long functions
    #- gocognit      # Computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions
    #- godot         # Check if comments end in a period
    #- golint        # Golint differs from gofmt. Gofmt reformats Go source code, whereas golint prints out style mistakes
    #- lll           # Reports long lines
    #- scopelint     # Scopelint checks for unpinned variables in go programs
    - bodyclose     # checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - deadcode      # Finds unused code
    - depguard      # Go linter that checks if package imports are in a list of acceptable packages
    - dupl          # Tool for code clone detection
    - errcheck      # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in go programs. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
    - exportloopref # checks for pointers to enclosing loop variables
    - goconst       # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant
    - gocritic      # The most opinionated Go source code linter
    - gocyclo       # Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions
    - gofmt         # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification
    - goimports     # Goimports does everything that gofmt does. Additionally it checks unused imports
    - gosec         # Inspects source code for security problems
    - gosimple      # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying a code
    - govet         # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign   # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - interfacer    # Linter that suggests narrower interface types
    - maligned      # Tool to detect Go structs that would take less memory if their fields were sorted
    - misspell      # Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments
    - nakedret      # Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
    - noctx         # noctx finds sending http request without context.Context
    - prealloc      # Finds slice declarations that could potentially be preallocated
    - rowserrcheck  # checks whether Err of rows is checked successfully
    - staticcheck   # Staticcheck is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - structcheck   # Finds unused struct fields
    - stylecheck    # Stylecheck is a replacement for golint
    - typecheck     # Like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unconvert     # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - unparam       # Reports unused function parameters
    - unused        # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types
    - varcheck      # Finds unused global variables and constants
    - whitespace    # Tool for detection of leading and trailing whitespace
